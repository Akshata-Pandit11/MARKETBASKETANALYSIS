                    Graphical analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the output of the Apriori algorithm and visualizing the relationships between items.
                    While the algorithm itself is computational, visualizing the results can provide valuable insights.
                    Identifying Strong Associations by visualizing association rules can help identify the most significant relationships between items.
                    Graphical representations can reveal hidden patterns and trends in the data.
                    Visualizations are effective for communicating results to stakeholders.
                     Graphical analysis can also help to generate new hypotheses for further investigation.
                     Thus graphical representaion helps us to understand the patterns and trends easily.For the same we use seaborn,plotly,matplotlib libraries.
