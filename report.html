                <b>Market Basket Analysisis</b> a data mining technique used to uncover patterns and relationships between products purchased together. 
                By analyzing large datasets of customer transactions, businesses can gain valuable insights into consumer behavior.
                Essentially, market basket analysis identifies items frequently purchased together. For instance, if customers often buy bread and butter together, the analysis will reveal this association.
                For the same we use Apriori algorithm-association rule to find the insights in the dataset.

                <b>Apriori algorithm</b> is a foundational technique in data mining, particularly in the realm of market basket analysis.
                It's designed to efficiently uncover frequent itemsets and generate association rules from large transactional datasets. 
                <i>The algorithm hinges on a straightforward principle: if an itemset &nbsp;is frequent, then all its subsets must also be frequent.</i>
                This is known as the Apriori property.Leveraging this property, Apriori employs a level-wise search approach to identify frequent itemsets.

                    <q>
                    Itemset is a collection of items.
                    Support is the proportion of transactions containing a specific itemset.
                    Confidence is the conditional probability of buying an item B, given that item A was bought.<br>
                    Lift is the Measures the increase in the probability of buying item B when item A is also bought.
                    Association Rule: A rule that indicates the relationship between two itemsets. It is represented as {antecedent} -> {consequent}.

                <q>To efficiently analyzing the hidden patterns and relations in the grocery transction data of a supermarket.
                    By identifying the most frequent of most happened pattern in the purchasing to understand the buyer's behavior towards different products.
                    The Goal of the project is to optimize the product placement,creating effective cross-selling strategies 
                    such that it will help to enhance the sales and overall performance of the supermarket.

                Dataset we used here is sourced from the Kaggle website

                <i>The attributes are:</i>Member number i.e the unique id for the customers given bty the supermarket.
                Date i.e billing date or the date when item is purchased. 
                ItemDescription contains the detail about the purchased itemset.The dataset has 38765 rows and 3 columns of object type.<i>Data Cleaning</i>,by handling the missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
                For<i> Data transforming</i> , we use the  python 
                libraries like pandas for handling dataframes and datetime for formatting the Date attribute.
